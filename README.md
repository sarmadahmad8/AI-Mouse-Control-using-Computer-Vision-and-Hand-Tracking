# AI-Mouse-Control-using-Computer-Vision-and-Hand-Tracking

Open INSTALLATION GUIDE.txt to see how to run the program.

Made this project using mediapipe for hand tracking and autopy for the mouse control. Works quite accurately and mouse movement can be smoothened or made faster by changing the 'smoothen' variable.
If Index and Middle fingers are being detected as closed then either move closer to webcam or increase the length condition in line 56.

Mouse Control:

1.Hold Index finger up to move mouse around the screen (both hands can be used but not simultaneously).

2.hold Both the Index and Middle finger up but spread both fingers away from each other.

3.Quickly close both fingers to make a click and then spread them away again.

4.Hold only Index finger up again to move mouse and repeat.

5. Press q on your keboard to stop the program.
